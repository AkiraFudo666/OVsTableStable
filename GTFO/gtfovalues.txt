Here lies some values that you may scan for.

If you are looking for the ammo for your primary and secondary they will both be '4 Bytes'
This is the most simplest of all things to scan for. However, your reserve ammo will not be a 4 byte.

Format for those who really... dont know:
f = Float
d = Double
Specifically for these two.

Player Health:
100% = 25.0f
/
Every 20% = 5.0f

Player Infection:
Example:
- 0.10 = 10% Infection
- 0.15 = 15% Infection
- 1.00 = 100% Infection

All Enemy healths (including unreleased enemies)
Released:
- Striker: 20.0f
- Shadow Striker: 20.0f
- Shooter: 30.0f
- Charger(Bull): 30.0f
- Striker_Child: 5.0f
- Scout: 42.0f
- Titan Striker: 120.0f
- Shadow Titan Striker: 120.0f
- Titan Shooter: 150.0f
- Hybrid(Hybirb): 150.0f
- InfectionSpitter(Parasite): N/A (The ballsacks do NOT have any health, you can find info about them when scanning for their timers)
- Birther: 5000.0f
  Tumor Health: 630.0f (Sometimes it will show as 631.0)
- Big Birther: 12500.0f
  Tumor Health: 1565.0f (Also, keep in mind that each Tumor on a Birther has it's very own health)
For these 3 enemies below, you will not be able to access them without the current mod menu.
Unreleased:
- Tank: 500.0f
- Toxic Titan Shooter: 150.0f
- Titan Striker Boss(Crawler): 120.0f

If you would really like to get indepth on enemy healths, you can even find their "Limb" healths.
How the Limb health works compared to the overall health of an enemy is by:

Say, Striker has 300.0 health. That is it's overall health which when it reaches 0.00 it dies and the body despawns at some point in time.
Now, the Limb health is totally separate from the overall health. By default with no edits, all Striker limbs are at: 10.0f health.

Since I haven't listed any multipliers, yet. I'll just say this now, multipliers do not work on the limb health but they do work on the enemy's overall health.
So now we have:
Striker health: 300.0
Left Arm health: 10.0

Now, you shoot the left arm from the backside of the enemy. (Say, your damage is 2.0 and backside multipliers are 5x your base damage)
(EXAMPLE)
Striker health: 290.0 (2.0 x 5 = 10.0 Damage)
Left Arm health: 8.0 (2.0 Damage dealt, because multipliers are ignored on limb healths)

If you are scanning for limb healths of an enemy and you think you messed up and decide to start on another limb, you don't have to.

Limb healths can go below 0 and into the negatives as long as the enemy's overall health does not reach 0.00
=======================================================================================================================================================================================

Now I will list enemy damage amounts per hit and for what attack.
You can try scanning for these but I myself haven't had any luck. :(

Here is the format: { ranged | melee }
- Normal Striker: 3.0 | N/A
- Normal Shooter: 1.2 | N/A
- Shadow Striker: 3.0 | N/A
- Baby Striker: 1.0 | N/A

- Charger: 4.5 | 1.0
- Scout: 1.0 | N/A

- Titan Striker: 6.0 | 10.0
- Titan Shooter: 1.5 | N/A
- Shadow Titan Striker: 6.0 | 10.0

- Hybrid: 0.9 | 3.0
- Small Birther: N/A | N/A
- Big Birther: N/A | N/A

- InfectionSpitters: (I actually forgot to check for this one)

=======================================================================================================================================================================================

Sweet, now here is how you can find your melee damage.

When you swing your melee just by simply left-clicking once, you have just dealt 4.0f damage whether you hit something or not.
So,
QuickTap = 4.0f
Full Charge = 20.0f

To find this, it is really easy.
Start off by selecting your melee weapon and swing it one time with a QuickTap.

So you should be scanning for a 4.0 as a Float (For the First Scan)
You'll have to now do a Full Charge (When the whole circle is lit up) and swing it.
This is going to be your second scan, you will be scanning for a 20.0 as a Float

Simply repeat back and forth from a 4.0 to a 20.0 and youll end up with your address.
Once you have it, just freeze and set the number to 99999 for example and QuickTap an enemy to try it out.

=======================================================================================================================================================================================

Hm, here is some info on InfectionSpitters.

InfectionSpitters do NOT have a health. They rely completely on timers.

When they haven't exploded their 1st main timer will be on 0.00f

When flashing your light on them it takes 0.60 seconds for them to retract and while they have been flashed, they will retract for 12.83 seconds.
If you were to shoot them, they would retract for 32.00 seconds. However, they have a second timer that relates in a way to regen or rather as an ability cooldown
which is their explosion. When they are forced to explode by a bullet, their 1st timer will increase to 32.00 seconds and on 28.00 seconds their explosion ability will
available again, which means you can shoot them after that 4th second goes by.

If you have a C-Foam Launcher and use 1 ammo use on an InfectionSpitter it will retract for 75.00 seconds. Except, during this time if you decide to shoot it it will explode
and the timer will be instantly reset to 32.00 seconds even if you shot it when it could've been on 60.00 seconds.

If you are trying to find their timers, it is quite simple.
Your first scan should be an Unknown Initial Value as a float. (You'll need an InfectionSpitter next to you for this)
To make things a little easier, setup your next scan for a value between "12 and 13" (FLOAT)
Turn on your flashlight and keep it on the InfectionSpitter to make it retract and start your second scan.

You may or may not get your result in just these 2 scans, for the 3rd scan change the scan to "Decreased Value" (do NOT scan yet)
Turn off your flashlight so that the InfectionSpitter's timer may decrease. Now you can start the 3rd scan.

The 4th scan should be pretty easy. Just wait for the InfectionSpitter to start glowing. That's how you will know when it's timer has finally reached 0 which will also be
your next scan value (Exact Value scan).

Then, your 5th scan will basically be exactly like your 2nd scan and setup.

=======================================================================================================================================================================================

For whatever reason, i'll just drop this here as well.

C-Foam Launcher:
Cooldown after firing a full charge: 2.5 seconds
Charge up time to make a full charge (Circle crosshair is completely white): 2.0 seconds

Bio Tracker:
Charge up time: 1.0 second
Cooldown per tag: 8.5 seconds

Mines:
Placement time: 0.5 seconds
Wait time inbetween each mine placement: 2.0 seconds
Pickup speed: 0.5 seconds

=======================================================================================================================================================================================
Mob Cap:
(FLOAT)
Max: 32.0f
Min: 25.0f

Each mob's unit amount:
- Normal Striker: 1.0f
- Normal Shooter: 1.0f
- Shadow Striker: 0.75f
- Baby Striker: 1.0f
- Titan Striker: 2.0f
- Shadow Titan Striker: 2.0f
- Titan Shooter: 2.0f
- Titan Hybrid: 2.0f
- Charger: 1.0f

=======================================================================================================================================================================================

Equipment Ammo:

Starting amount: 100.0f
Max amount: 150.0f

And for consumables... tbh, I forgot. Consumables should be floats? maybe.
I think "PocketItems" like glowsticks are floats as well.

Ah right, if youare going to look for a glowstick's timer for how long it will last, keep in ming the address changes everytime you throw a new glowstick.
It will start on 0.50f
